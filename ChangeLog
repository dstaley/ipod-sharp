2005-08-03  James Willcox  <snorp@snorp.net>

	* src/SongDatabase.cs: change unknownOne in PlaylistItemRecord to be 0
	instead of 1, as that's what iTunes does.  Make PadLength 8 to see if
	that "fixes" problems with 4th devices.
	* src/Device.cs: add AdvertisedCapacity property
	* src/Capacities.cs: new file, gets advertised capacity info, given
	a model number.
	* src/capacities.txt: a little text db that maps model -> capacity

2005-07-26  James Willcox  <snorp@snorp.net>

	* src/Device.cs: wrap the new device properties in libipoddevice

2005-07-26  James Willcox  <snorp@snorp.net>

2005-07-26  James Willcox  <snorp@snorp.net>

	* src/SongDatabase.cs: write all the extra unknown fields out in
	TrackRecord, if the database version is >= 12.

2005-07-26  James Willcox  <snorp@snorp.net>

	* src/SongDatabase.cs: when dealing with tracks, don't read/write
	the 'remainder'.

2005-07-20  James Willcox  <snorp@snorp.net>

2005-07-20  James Willcox  <snorp@snorp.net>

	* src/Initializer.cs: use a separate thread for hal
	* ui/DeviceCombo.cs: since events come in on a thread, do stuff
	in an idle handler.

2005-07-19  James Willcox  <snorp@snorp.net>

	* src/SongDatabase.cs: s/StatusHandler/SaveProgressHandler/ and add a
	'currentPercent' argument to it, which represents how much of the
	current song has been copied.  Also, made the Save method provide
	that information.

	* ui/ProgressDialog.cs: use the new 'currentPercent' info to provide
	a smoother progress bar.

2005-07-19  James Willcox  <snorp@snorp.net>

2005-07-18  James Willcox  <snorp@snorp.net>

	* src/SongDatabase.cs: remove from the 'library' playlist when removing a song.

	* src/Makefile.am, tests/Makefile.am, ui/Makefile.am, tools/Makefile.am:
	Update compiler flags -o -> -out: and -r -> -debug

2005-07-12  James Willcox  <snorp@snorp.net>

	* src/Makefile.am, ui/Makefile.am: since ipod-sharp[-ui] is still
	in development, don't install the assemblies to the GAC.
	* ipod-sharp.pc.in, ipod-sharp-ui.pc.in: add a 'Libraries' variable
	that contains the path to the assembly for apps to copy.

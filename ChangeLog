	* src/Device.cs: In Device::Save(), check for null against the
	fields instead of the properties for the databases, otherwise
	it would always be true. Helps BGO#588101 as a workaround for

	Apple decided to use to lock out third party clients

2007-09-17  James Willcox  <snorp@snorp.net>

2007-09-10  James Willcox  <snorp@snorp.net>

	* src/Device.cs: change the #ifdef to WINDOWS instead of DOTNET
	and remove all of the runtime OS checking.

2007-08-10  Justin Cherniak <justin.cherniak@gmail.com>

	within the TrackListRecord.

2007-08-04  Justin Cherniak <justin.cherniak@gmail.com>
	
	* src/Device.cs: changed ListDevices() so that it relies on the
	platform device to generate IPod.Devices instead of doing the
	conversion b/w IDevices and Devices itself

	* src/PhotoDatabase.cs: Added checks to LookupPhoto functions (faster
	than catching exceptions)

	* src/SysInfoExtended.cs: Compatibility fix for Windows Vista.

	* src/Track.cs: Added the following fields: DiscNumber, TotalDiscs,
	BPM, AlbumArtist, Composer, LatestRating, LastLastModifiedTime.  Added 
	write accessors for DateAdded, Size.  Compatibility fix for URI 
	generation under Win32

	* src/TrackDatabase.cs: Added TrackAdded/TrackRemoved events, support
	for Track.LatestRating.  Compatibility fixes for Win32.  Added
	CreateTrack overload which copies the track to the iPod immediately
	versus waiting for TrackDatabase.Save()

	* src/Win32/DeviceEventListener.cs:  Rewrote Win32.DeviceEventListener
	so that it mainly operates statically.  This allows it to keep one
	list of Devices instead of creating different devices for different
	listeners (when in truth, they would be the same physical device).

	* src/Win32/Device.cs: Now gets its device list from
	DeviceEventListener.

2007-08-03  Justin Cherniak <justin.cherniak@gmail.com>
	
	Recursively applied svn:eol-style=native to all text files

2007-07-02  Justin Cherniak <justin.cherniak@gmail.com>

	Added Win32 support to the library.
	
	* All Mono specific bits are cased in "#if !DOTNET" blocks to allow 
	the code to compile for windows using Microsoft .NET (All Win32 specific
	code compiles under Mono, so to build a cross platform build, use mono.
	This allows the code to be compiled under Micrsoft .NET for Windows use)

	* src/Unix: Moved Unix specific implementations (Device.cs, 
	DeviceAddedHandler.cs, DeviceEventListener.cs,
	DeviceRemovedHandler.cs, Initializer.cs) to this directory and to
	IPod.Unix namespace
	
	* src/Win32: Added Windows specific implementation of Device.cs in 
	IPod.Win32 namespace
	
	* src/Device.cs: Completely redone.  Moved all platform specific stuff
	to src/Unix/Device.cs and src/Win32/Device.cs.  This file now creates 
	and uses one of the platform specific devices depending on the OS on
	which it is run.

	* src/IDevice.cs: Interface that both Unix and Win32 Devices implement
	so that Ipod.Device can utilize either one depending on the runtime OS.

	* src/PhotoDatabase.cs: Changed Mono specific call to .NET call.

	* src/TrackDatabase.cs: Added Win32 FlushFileBuffers call for .NET
	compilation
	
	* src/SysInfo.cs: Rudementary parser for the SysInfo file stored on the
	iPod.  Currently only used in the Win32 implementation.
	
	* src/SysInfoExtended.cs: XML Parser for SysInfoExtended stored in the 
	iPod firmware.  Some code taken from libipoddevice.  Currently only used
	in the Win32 implementation.
	
	* src/Win32/WinAPI.cs: Included Win32 API Wrappers used throughout the
	solution

	* src/Win32/DeviceEventListener.cs:
	* src/Win32/DeviceWatcherWindow.cs: Implements a DeviceEventListener
	for Win32 by monitoring WM_DEVICECHANGE

	* src/Unix/DeviceEventLister.cs: Moved to IPod.Unix namespace.
	
	* src/Unix/Device.cs: Removed common (between platforms) functionality 
	to IPod.Device. Added explict conversion between IPod.Device

	* src/ipod-sharp.csproj: Added Visual Studio 2005 project with DOTNET 
	compilation symbol on by default (allowing library to build in Visual
	Studio for Win32 with Microsoft .NET)

	* src/ipod-sharp.mdp: Updated project to reflect new paths

2007-06-19  James Willcox  <snorp@snorp.net>

	* configure.ac: bump to 0.6.4

2007-06-19  James Willcox  <snorp@snorp.net>

	* src/Device.cs:
	* src/SportKitManager.cs: Implement support for iPod Sport devices.

	  workouts of each sport kit stored on the selected iPod for debugging
	  purposes.

	* src/Firmware/DmgFirmwareExtract.cs: Updated so my old work isn't lost,

	* tests/IPodTests.cs: Device device = new Device() changed to just

2005-08-03  James Willcox  <snorp@snorp.net>

	* src/SongDatabase.cs: add stuff for reading/writing library index

2005-08-03  James Willcox  <snorp@snorp.net>

	* src/SongDatabase.cs: change unknownOne in PlaylistItemRecord to be 0
	instead of 1, as that's what iTunes does.  Make PadLength 8 to see if
	that "fixes" problems with 4th devices.
	* src/Device.cs: add AdvertisedCapacity property
	* src/Capacities.cs: new file, gets advertised capacity info, given
	a model number.
	* src/capacities.txt: a little text db that maps model -> capacity

2005-07-26  James Willcox  <snorp@snorp.net>

	* src/Device.cs: wrap the new device properties in libipoddevice

2005-07-26  James Willcox  <snorp@snorp.net>

	* src/SongDatabase.cs: write all the extra unknown fields out in
	TrackRecord, if the database version is >= 12.

	* src/SongDatabase.cs: when dealing with tracks, don't read/write
	the 'remainder'.

2005-07-20  James Willcox  <snorp@snorp.net>

	* src/Initializer.cs: use a separate thread for hal
	* ui/DeviceCombo.cs: since events come in on a thread, do stuff
	in an idle handler.

2005-07-19  James Willcox  <snorp@snorp.net>

	* src/SongDatabase.cs: s/StatusHandler/SaveProgressHandler/ and add a
	'currentPercent' argument to it, which represents how much of the
	current song has been copied.  Also, made the Save method provide
	that information.

	* ui/ProgressDialog.cs: use the new 'currentPercent' info to provide
	a smoother progress bar.

2005-07-19  James Willcox  <snorp@snorp.net>

	in development, don't install the assemblies to the GAC.
	* ipod-sharp.pc.in, ipod-sharp-ui.pc.in: add a 'Libraries' variable
	that contains the path to the assembly for apps to copy.
